### Welcome to the JS-Workshop
----
##### 1. Setting up a development environment

Open up **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (our text editor of choice). This is a text editor by Microsoft, and is one among the leading text editors used by developers. It comes packed with a lot of really nice and helpful features which helps in reducing the time spent in writing code. 
Lets femiliarize ourself with it first.
> Create a new file called `test.c` and write a Hello world program.

I'll demonstrate a few techniques which will help you write code faster with this editor

_Note: This is only a text editor. Hence, to run the code we write in it, we need an external compiler. VS Code is soley meant to write code not execute it_

_To compile C code, we use **gcc** (GNU C Compiler). Similarly, to run javascript on our local machine, we use nodejs._

##### 2. Introduction to nodejs

Back in the day, when web development was in it's infancy, Javascript was a language being used only in web browsers. Now, with nodejs, it can be run on any computer and is being used eveywhere. By everywhere, I mean, even **VS Code** was written using Javascript.

**Where is nodejs and js being used?**
•  Web apps and web browsers (Duh...)
•  Mobile Apps (Instagram, Facebook, Airbnb, ...)
•  Desktop Apps (VSCode, Atom, ...The electron framework)
•  VR (react-vr)
•  Embedded microcontrollers (Espruino)

> Conclusion: Javascript is eveywhere. Learning it can only mean that you have a headstart in doing anything you want

##### 3. Lets get started!

Eventhough javascript can be a programming language, its seldom used to write console applications like how we are taught in VTU. We usually use command-line arguments or a GUI to get the input. 

Because of this, we will not be working with user input data, rather we will be understanding the core concepts of Nodejs using static data. 

> However, console inputs can be achieved using a library called `sget` which parses the input and makes using the input data much easier
