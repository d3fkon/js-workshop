 * Welcome!
 * 
 * We will be working with a git repository to walk through the different stages of learning nodejs and js
 * 
 * 
 * Before doing anything! Just remember these three words
 * 
 * SAVE -> STASH -> CHECKOUT
 * 
 * I will soon explain what they mean and how to perform them,
 * but just remember to perform these before moving to a new stage.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Enjoy the ride!
